# Dating With Friends

A dating app for your friends.

## Concept

Dating is all about finding someone who shares similar values and life goals to you, that you are physically attracted to. Popular dating apps today attempt understand your values based on questionaires and images of the potential partner. But they completely ignore the time tested method of finding a partner: through your friends! You friends are your friends because they share values with you, and so it makes sense that _their_ friends share values with you as well. What better way to find a partner than to get a recommendation from someone you trust?

Dating With Friends introduces a kind of 'barely blind dating' that utilizes the social structures already in place in our lives to find that special someone (or, maybe, _another friend_ to help you find that someone).

Start with a couple _seeds_, aka someone you trust. Each match you recieve will be someone that shares a friend with you. Your mutuals will _plan your dates for you_ and fill out most of your profile.
